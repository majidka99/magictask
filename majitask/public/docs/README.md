## ðŸ“– Documentation Philosophy

We've consolidated all user-facing documentation into a single, comprehensive README.md to provide:

- **Single Source of Truth**: All essential information in one place
- **Better Discoverability**: Users don't need to hunt through multiple files
- **Cleaner Repository**: Reduced clutter in the root directory
- **Easier Maintenance**: One file to keep updated instead of many

The `/docs` folder contains detailed technical documentation, development resources, and historical records that are important but not needed for daily usage.
